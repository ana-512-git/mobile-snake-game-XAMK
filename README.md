# Snake

## Description
The final Unity project in the XAMK Intro to Game Creation course: a mobile snake game. It's a self-made clone of the classic game "Snake" with a few additional features.

## How to play
### Controls
Although the game was designed to work on mobile, it is also desktop adapted, as it was necessary for testing during development. For mobile, swiping in one of the 4 directions will make the snake change its
direction to the one of the swipe. For desktop, movement happens in a similar matter, by left clicking, holding and moving the mouse on the screen, instead of your finger.

### Gameplay
The game was designed on levels, each with increasing difficulty. To advance, the snake must eat all of the eggs without touching the red spikes, the surrounding rocks or itself. Each level you advance, the number
of spikes and the snake's speed increase. In each level, there are a number of regular eggs and a golden one. Eating the golden egg will automatically trigger level advancement, and the snake will start at the center
of the screen with its new speed.
